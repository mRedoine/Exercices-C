1. Write a program that reads input until encountering the # character and then reports
the number of spaces read, the number of newline characters read, and the number of all
other characters read.

2. Write a program that reads input until encountering # . Have the program print each
input character and its ASCII decimal code. Print eight character-code pairs per line.
Suggestion: Use a character count and the modulus operator ( % ) to print a newline
character for every eight cycles of the loop.

3. Write a program that reads integers until 0 is entered. After input terminates, the
program should report the total number of even integers (excluding the 0) entered, the
average value of the even integers, the total number of odd integers entered, and the
average value of the odd integers.

4. Using if else statements, write a program that reads input up to # , replaces each period
with an exclamation mark, replaces each exclamation mark initially present with two
exclamation marks, and reports at the end the number of substitutions it has made.

5. Redo exercise 4 using a switch .

6. Write a program that reads input up to # and reports the number of times that the
sequence ei occurs.
Note
The program will have to “remember” the preceding character as well as the current character.
Test it with input such as “Receive your eieio award.”

7. Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300
20% of the next $150
25% of the rest
Use #define constants, and don’t worry if the example does not conform to current
tax law.
