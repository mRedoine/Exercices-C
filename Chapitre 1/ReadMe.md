1. Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to print your first and last names on one line.
The output should look like this (but using your name):
Gustav Mahler <- First print statement
Gustav <- Second print statement
Mahler <- Still the second print statement
Gustav Mahler <- Third and fourth print statements

2. Write a program to print your name and address.

3. Write a program that converts your age in years to days and displays both values. At this
point, don’t worry about fractional years and leap years.

4. Write a program that produces the following output:
For he's a jolly good fellow!
For he's a jolly good fellow!
For he's a jolly good fellow!
Which nobody can deny!
Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main() : one named
jolly() that prints the “jolly good” message once, and one named deny() that prints
the final line once.

5. Write a program that produces the following output:
Brazil, Russia, India, China
India, China,
Brazil, Russia
Have the program use two user-defined functions in addition to main() : one named
br() that prints “Brazil, Russia” once, and one named ic() that prints “India, China”
once. Let main() take care of any additional printing tasks.

6. Write a program that creates an integer variable called toes . Have the program set toes
to 10 . Also have the program calculate what twice toes is and what toes squared is. The
program should print all three values, identifying them.

7. Many studies suggest that smiling has benefits. Write a program that produces the
following output:
Smile!Smile!Smile!
Smile!Smile!
Smile!
Have the program define a function that displays the string Smile! once, and have the
program use the function as often as needed.

8. In C, one function can call another. Write a program that calls a function named one_
three() . This function should display the word one on one line, call a second function
named two() , and then display the word three on one line. The function two() should
display the word two on one line. The main() function should display the phrase
starting now: before calling one_three() and display done! after calling it. Thus, the
output should look like the following:
starting now:
one
two
three
done!
